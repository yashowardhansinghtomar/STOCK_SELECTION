## 🧠 O.D.I.N. Project Status — Mid-2025 Snapshot

This document reflects the current architecture and operating state of the O.D.I.N. system. It highlights how data flows from ingestion to decision-making, where intelligence lives, and what assumptions or risks remain.

---

## 1. What the system is currently doing (real-time data → decision → learning)

| Stage                 | Main components                                                                                          | Critical data artefacts                        | Purpose & key logic                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ingest + Storage**  | `zerodha_fetcher`, `data_provider`, PostgreSQL                                                           | `stock_price_history`, `stock_fundamentals`    | Pull raw OHLCV & fundamentals, normalise time-zones, store in per-interval partitions.                               |
| **Feature Fabric**    | `feature_provider` → `feature_enricher_multi` **(batch)**                                                | `stock_features` DuckDB-backed table           | Multi-interval TA enrichment; SQL cache-on-miss ensures lazy, consistent feature gen. Redis & threads fully removed. |
| **Planning Layer**    | `PlannerAgentSQL` (EoW) + `IntradayPlannerAgent` (EoD)                                                   | `ml_selected_stocks`, `recommendations`        | Freshen data → fundamental check → call **strategy layer** → push configs to execution.                              |
| **Strategy Layer**    | - RF + PPO dual models<br> - `StrategyAgent` + `RLStrategyAgent`<br> - `JointPolicyModel` (shadows both) | `param_model_prediction`, `replay_buffer_sql`  | Predict enter/size/exit using best model. Arbitration resolves RF vs PPO vs JointPolicy.                             |
| **Execution**         | `ExecutionAgentSQL`, `bootstrap_trader.py`                                                               | `open_positions`, `paper_trades`, `system_log` | Paper/live trade placement; logs full trade metadata, applies live exit rules. Bootstrap mode supports exploration.  |
| **Memory / Feedback** | `feedback_loop.py`, `ReplayBuffer`, `log_replay_row`                                                     | `training_data`, `replay_buffer_sql`           | Each trade (real/virtual) becomes a labeled sample. Logs missed/rejected trades too.                                 |
| **Self-Improvement**  | `train_joint_policy_flow.py`, `train_rl_policy_flow.py`, `MemoryAgent` triggers                          | `model_store`, `ppo_buffer`                    | PPO retrains from full replay buffer, JointPolicyModel distills unified logic from same.                             |

> ✅ Net result: System now learns from **trades taken + skipped**. Bootstrap fills early data gap. Models retrain weekly. Exploration is structured.

## 2. Bootstrap Lifecycle: From Nothing to Competence

| Phase | Goal                      | Driver                | Data Source            | Trigger to Advance                 |
| ----- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0     | Generate initial trades   | `run_bootstrap.py`    | Historical (simulated) | 200+ executed trades               |
| 1     | ε-greedy real trades      | `bootstrap_trader.py` | Real-time + heuristics | Model begins converging (Sharpe ↑) |
| 2     | Policy-led trading begins | `ExecutionAgentSQL`   | Mixed replay + live    | JointPolicy & RL model stabilize   |

## 3. Hidden assumptions & emerging risks

| Area                  | Implicit assumption                   | Why it may break                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Replay realism**    | Simulated fills mimic real execution  | Gaps in slippage, latency, partial fills need continuous tuning |
| **Phase thresholds**  | 200 trades = ready for policy         | May need tuning per market regime                               |
| **Exploration decay** | ε drops naturally with learning       | Might stagnate without enough regime diversity                  |
| **Replay tagging**    | Tags are consistent across components | Requires centralized schema validation                          |

## 4. Core improvements recently made

| Theme                        | Change                                                | Impact                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Bootstrap System**    | `run_full_bootstrap.py` script + `run_bootstrap.py`   | System can simulate full learning loop from scratch                     |
| **Replay Enrichment**        | Full logging of missed, rejected, and executed trades | PPO now learns from complete trade landscape — better credit assignment |
| **Joint Policy Integration** | `JointPolicyModel` predicts enter/size/exit jointly   | Reduces model clutter, unifies decision logic                           |
| **Feature Store**            | `feature_provider.py` + DuckDB cache-on-miss pipeline | Removes Redis/Pickle/thread overhead; caching transparent to agents     |

## 5. What’s not yet done / still experimental

| Area                        | Status         | Planned Approach                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regime-aware curriculum** | 🕐 In design   | Simulation phases gated by volatility regimes + success metrics (IC, Sharpe)    |
| **Position-size rewards**   | 🕐 Partial     | PPO to reward capital-efficiency, not raw P\&L                                  |
| **Live RL inference**       | 🟡 Shadow mode | RLStrategyAgent can run live, but policy\_chooser still uses mostly Joint or RF |
| **Unified scoring metric**  | 🕐 Mixed       | Still balancing Sharpe, expected return, confidence for signal sorting          |

## 6. Architecture Shift Map

| Legacy                  | New Standard                                  | Status      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Threaded feature script | DuckDB cache-on-miss via `feature_provider`   | ✅ Complete  |
| Grid/param/dual models  | Unified `JointPolicyModel`                    | ✅ Shadowed  |
| Cold-start guesswork    | Bootstrap lifecycle with replay-driven policy | ✅ Complete  |
| PPO as fallback         | PPO trains continuously; JointPolicy distills | ✅ In-flight |

---

## 7. Design philosophy (Updated)

* ⛓️ **Decide once, learn everywhere** — every signal taken/skipped is stored for model learning.
* 🧠 **Start wrong, improve fast** — bootstrap makes mistakes early so models can learn adaptively.
* ⏱️ **Exploration with guardrails** — ε-greedy exploration under drawdown caps and reward tagging.
* 🎯 **Replay is ground truth** — all training is grounded in actions actually taken (real or simulated).

## Summary

> O.D.I.N. is now **capable of bootstrapping from zero**. With one script, it simulates trades, learns from outcomes, and begins model evolution. The next frontier? Gradual handoff to the RL + JointPolicy engine, with regime-aware learning and reward shaping.
