## Detailed Module Descriptions

### backtester Folder

This folder contains the core modules for backtesting the strategy.

- **config.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Contains configuration settings such as the output directory.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Defines a constant (e.g., `OUTPUT_DIR = "results"`) and ensures that the folder exists.  
    - Use this module to centralize paths and configurable parameters for the system.

- **logger_setup.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Handles logging across the system.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Sets up a global logger that logs to `results/backtest.log` if enabled.  
    - Provides a helper function `log_message(msg)` to write messages to the logger (or to the console if logging is disabled).

- **data.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Downloads and preprocesses stock data.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Uses `yfinance` to fetch data based on the ticker symbol, start, and end dates.  
    - Includes retry logic and error handling.  
    - If the downloaded data has identical column names, it reassigns them to the standard OHLCV format.

- **indicators.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Calculates technical indicators needed for the strategy.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Computes simple moving averages (`SMA_short`, `SMA_long`) over configurable windows.  
    - Calculates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) using a standard method (difference of closing prices, gain/loss separation, rolling averages, etc.).  
    - Ensures that there are enough data points before removing missing values.

- **strategy.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Simulates the trading strategy using realistic assumptions.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Implements next-day execution (orders are executed at the next day’s open price to simulate data lag).  
    - Incorporates transaction costs and slippage (both on entry and exit).  
    - Uses a 14-day ATR (Average True Range) to set stop loss levels; exits if the price falls below a multiple of ATR.  
    - Applies dynamic position sizing: if the RSI is below a threshold (e.g., 40), position size increases (e.g., 1.5× vs. 1×).  
    - Includes max drawdown protection that forces an exit if the portfolio’s drawdown exceeds a set threshold.

- **performance.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Calculates performance metrics for the strategy.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Computes total return, annualized return, annualized volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.  
    - Uses the portfolio’s daily percentage change to derive volatility and risk-adjusted returns.

- **walkforward.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Performs walk–forward testing on the strategy.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Splits historical data into training and test windows.  
    - Optimizes parameters (e.g., different SMA combinations) on the training window and tests on the subsequent window.  
    - Aggregates window-level results and saves them as JSON for each ticker.

- **comparative.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Aggregates optimization results across multiple tickers.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Runs parameter optimization on each ticker’s data, comparing different parameter sets (e.g., ranges of SMA values).  
    - Outputs the best-performing parameters and performance metrics into CSV files, and generates comparative plots.

- **backtest.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Serves as an integration point for running a single ticker’s advanced backtest.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Calls functions from the data, indicators, strategy, and performance modules.  
    - Optionally generates portfolio value plots (or adds them to a PDF report).

- **main.py**  
  - **Purpose:** The main entry point for the backtesting engine.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Parses command-line arguments to choose between standard backtest, walk–forward testing, or comparative analysis.  
    - Loads the list of stocks from `stock_selecter/filtered_stocks.csv`.  
    - Directs output to the `results` folder (CSV, JSON, PDF, logs).

### analysis Folder

This folder contains tools for interactive analysis and visualization of the backtesting outputs.

- **analyze.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Provides a command-line based analysis of aggregated performance and walk–forward testing results.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Loads performance data from CSV and walk–forward testing JSON files.  
    - Generates summary tables and plots (e.g., bar charts of Sharpe ratios, scatter plots of return vs. volatility).

- **app.py**  
  - **Purpose:** Implements an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.  
  - **Details:**  
    - Lets users filter stocks by performance thresholds (annualized return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown).  
    - Flags stocks that meet high-performance criteria.  
    - Displays detailed analysis for a selected ticker (including historical portfolio curves and walk–forward results).  
    - Run with the command: `streamlit run app.py`.

### historical_data Folder

- **Contents:**  
  - CSV files containing historical price data (OHLCV) for each stock (e.g., ABB.csv, SUZLON.csv).  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Acts as a local repository of market data used for backtesting.

### fundamentals Folder

- **Contents:**  
  - CSV files with fundamental data (e.g., EQUITY.csv, fundamental_data.csv) and a script for extracting such data.  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Provides a basis for incorporating fundamental analysis or screening into the trading strategy.

### model Folder

- **Contents:**  
  - A pickled machine learning model (`best_model.pkl`) and a training script (`ml_training.py`).  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Contains components for building and testing predictive models that may enhance the strategy.

### results Folder

- **Contents:**  
  - Outputs from backtesting and analysis, including aggregated performance CSVs, walk–forward JSON files, logs (`backtest.log`), and PDF reports of charts.  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Serves as the central repository for all generated outputs. These files are used for further analysis and as historical records.

### stock_selecter Folder

- **Contents:**  
  - `filtered_stocks.csv` and a stock screener script (`stock_screener.py`).  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Filters stocks based on predefined criteria. The resulting CSV file is used by the backtesting engine to decide which stocks to analyze.

### Other Backtesting Scripts

- **backtesting.py, backtesting_simplified.py, backtesting_simplified2.py**  
  - **Purpose:**  
    - These files represent earlier iterations or simplified versions of the backtesting engine.  
    - They can be used for quick testing or as references for further development.

## Data Flow & Functionalities

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - The system starts by reading the filtered list of stocks from `stock_selecter/filtered_stocks.csv`.  
   - Historical data is either fetched via yfinance (using `data.py`) or loaded from local CSVs in `historical_data`.

2. **Indicator Calculation:**  
   - The system calculates technical indicators (moving averages and RSI) from the price data using `indicators.py`.

3. **Strategy Simulation:**  
   - Trades are simulated using realistic assumptions: orders are executed at the next day’s open, transaction costs and slippage are applied on both entry and exit, and risk management is implemented using ATR-based stop loss and dynamic position sizing (detailed in `strategy.py`).

4. **Performance Evaluation:**  
   - Key performance metrics (total return, annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown) are computed using `performance.py`.

5. **Walk-Forward Testing:**  
   - The system performs walk–forward testing by splitting the data into training and test windows, optimizing parameters on the training window, and evaluating performance on the test window (handled by `walkforward.py`).

6. **Comparative Analysis:**  
   - Multiple tickers are processed to aggregate and compare performance metrics and parameter optimizations (via `comparative.py`).

7. **Interactive Analysis:**  
   - The analysis tools (both command-line in `analyze.py` and interactive dashboard in `app.py`) let you filter and visualize performance data, examine historical portfolio curves, and explore detailed walk–forward results.

8. **Alerts and Aggregation:**  
   - The interactive dashboard flags high-performing stocks (e.g., high annualized returns, strong Sharpe ratios, low drawdowns) and allows users to further drill down into the data.

## How to Run the System

### Backtesting Engine

- **Command-Line Execution:**  
  Navigate to the `backtester` folder and run the main engine:
  ```bash
  python main.py --log --report
  ```
  Available options:  
  - `--log`: Enables logging to a file.  
  - `--walk_forward`: Runs walk–forward testing.  
  - `--report`: Generates a PDF report with all plots.  
  - `--compare`: Runs comparative analysis across multiple tickers.

- **Data Source:**  
  The engine reads stock symbols from `stock_selecter/filtered_stocks.csv`.

### Analysis Tools

- **Command-Line Analysis:**  
  Run the analysis script:
  ```bash
  python analysis/analyze.py --performance --plot
  ```
  This displays the aggregated performance metrics and related plots.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Run the Streamlit app (after installing Streamlit):
  ```bash
  streamlit run analysis/app.py
  ```
  This opens a web interface where you can filter, view, and interact with the backtesting data.

### Additional Scripts

- **Fundamental Data & ML Model:**  
  The `fundamentals` folder contains scripts to extract and analyze fundamental data.  
  The `model` folder includes a training script and a pickled machine learning model. These can be integrated with the backtesting outputs for a combined technical/fundamental or ML-based approach.
