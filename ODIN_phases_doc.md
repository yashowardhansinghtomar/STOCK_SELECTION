## 🧭 **Date-wise Deep Dive: Bootstrap Learning Lifecycle**

---

### 📅 **📍 January 1, 2023 (Day 1 of Simulation)**

* **Filter Model**:

  * Uses technical indicators computed from **data strictly before Jan 1, 2023** (e.g., Nov–Dec 2022).
  * It selects promising stocks based on patterns like SMA crossover, RSI levels, volatility bands.

* **Model State**:

  * No prior trades yet → no models trained.
  * No replay buffer data.

* **Trade Generator**:

  * `PhaseController.phase == 0` → selects `generate_random_trades()`
    This is defined in: `trade_generator.py` → **`generate_random_trades()`**
  * It places **random long/short trades** on selected stocks:

    * Entry time = market open (e.g., 09:15)
    * Size = random 0.1–1%
    * Exit = after 1 day

* **Execution Simulation**:

  * Uses minute-bar data from Jan 1 to simulate order fills and exits.
  * Includes slippage, latency, partial fills, execution noise.

* **Replay Buffer**:

  * Adds these trades with tags:
    `phase=0`, `source=synthetic`, `vol_regime=low|med`, `exploration_type=random`

---

### 📅 **📍 January 2, 2023**

* **Filter Model**:

  * Uses data up to Jan 1, 2023 (no future leakage).

* **Replay Buffer**:

  * Now includes trades from Jan 1.

* **Model Training (Friday check skipped)**:

  * Only retrains on Fridays, so no model yet.

* **Trade Generator**:

  * Still `Phase 0` (unless 200+ real trades hit).
  * More random trades added.

---

### 📆 **📍 First Friday of Simulation (e.g., Jan 6, 2023)**

* **Model Trainer Triggered**:

  * It uses the replay buffer (trades from Jan 1–5) to train:

    * RL PPO agent
    * Joint Policy Model

* **Replay Training Constraint**:

  * Only trades available *up to that Friday* are used.
  * Ensures strict temporal separation.

* **Phase Check**:

  * If `replay_buffer.count_real_trades() > 200` → phase upgraded to **1**.
  * Otherwise, Phase 0 continues.

---

### 🔄 **📅 Jan 7 – June 30, 2023: Rest of Simulation Loop**

* **Trade Generation** evolves based on phase:

---

#### 📍 If still **Phase 0** (not enough trades):

* Continue placing random trades every day.
* If few stocks are selected or volatility is low, trade count stays low.
* This **triggers you to widen selection**, increase budget, or inject synthetic noise.

---

#### 📍 Once **Phase 1** begins:

* `PhaseController.phase = 1`
* System uses **ε-greedy logic**:

  * 80%: `generate_rule_based_trades()` (e.g., RSI < 30 + volume spike)
  * 20%: `generate_random_trades()`
* Gradually populates buffer with **guided trades**.

---

#### 📍 Weekly on Fridays:

* Retrains both RL and joint models
* Uses entire replay buffer accumulated up to that Friday
* Checks for model convergence using reward stability
* If models converge → advances to **Phase 2**

---

### 📍 **Phase 2 — Model-Guided Exploration**

* Now trades are generated using:
  **`generate_model_based_trades()`**

  * These use outputs from trained joint policy:

    * Predicted size, direction, exit rule, confidence

* Only data until that date is used for predictions.

* Rewards and performance are tracked closely:

  * Sharpe by regime
  * State coverage
  * Trade diversity
  * IC (Information Coefficient)

---

## ❓What if <200 trades happen in Jan–Jun 2023?

* You **stay in Phase 0**: system doesn't promote itself.
* Replay buffer logs why (e.g., not enough filtered stocks, low volatility).
* Fixes:

  * Reduce stock filter strictness
  * Increase days covered
  * Inject synthetic trades
  * Simulate with a broader universe

## ✅ Summary Table: Day-wise Behavior

| Date           | Filter Trains On    | Trade Type    | Models Trained? | Phase     | Key Transitions                       |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Jan 1, 2023    | Data up to Dec 31   | Random        | ❌ No            | Phase 0   | First day, kicks off random trades    |
| Jan 2–5        | Data up to Jan 1–4  | Random        | ❌ No            | Phase 0   | Replay fills up slowly                |
| Jan 6 (Friday) | Jan 1–5 trades      | Random        | ✅ First train   | Phase 0/1 | Phase upgrade if 200+ trades achieved |
| Jan 7–onwards  | Data up to D–1      | Rule + Random | ✅ Weekly train  | Phase 1   | ε-greedy exploration begins           |
| Phase 2 begins | Data from Phase 0+1 | Model-guided  | ✅ Full loop     | Phase 2   | When models stabilize in Phase 1      |

## 🧠 Insight:

> The system doesn't assume it's smart. It **earns its intelligence**, one trade at a time.




## ✅ What `run_full_bootstrap.py` Does

It’s a **bootstrapping script** designed to:

1. **Simulate past learning** (Phase 0 → Phase 2)
2. **Begin live trades** today with exploration (Phase 1 behavior)
3. **Train models** with accumulated replay buffer
4. **Deliver** a policy that's ready to act more intelligently

But its job **ends** when:

* A stable policy has emerged
* The replay buffer has 500–1000+ tagged, diverse trades
* Model outputs are **non-random and meaningful**

Then the system needs to move to **ongoing self-operation mode**.

---

## 🔄 What Happens *After* Phase 2

Once Phase 2 is reached, **the bootstrap phase is complete**.

Now you switch to the **daily self-learning loop** (production mode).

## 🧠 Post-Bootstrap Daily Architecture

| Component                                     | Role                                             | Run By                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `filter_model.run()`                          | Select stocks each morning using latest features | Called by `planner_router.py`     |
| `joint_policy.predict()` or `RL_policy.act()` | Decide entry, size, exit on selected stocks      | Core live trader (T.R.A.D.E.R.)   |
| `execution_agent`                             | Submit live trades                               | Live or paper API                 |
| `replay_logger`                               | Log all outcomes, rewards, metadata              | `S.P.A.R.K.`                      |
| `model_trainer`                               | Retrain weekly or on trigger                     | Cron or RL monitor                |
| `monitor_system_flow.py`                      | Summarize Sharpe, regime, epsilon, drawdowns     | Daily via `monitor.sh` or Prefect |

---

## 🔁 In Plain English

> After bootstrapping, your system **graduates from learning to learning-while-doing.**

* **Phase 3**: ε ≈ 0.05 → nearly all actions are **model-based**
* Models improve every few days via **live feedback**
* Exploration never fully ends, but is **targeted** (e.g., in high-uncertainty stocks or new symbols)

---

## ✅ Daily Flow Post-Bootstrap (Phase 3)

```bash
# Early Morning
python planner_router.py           # ← Calls stock filter + model + generates trades

# Midday / EoD
python execution_agent_sql.py     # ← Executes and logs trades

# Every Evening
python monitor_system_flow.py     # ← Logs Sharpe, PnL, drift, anomalies

# Every Sunday
python -m model_trainer.trainer   # ← Retrains with fresh replay data
```

You may also add:

* `drift_detector.py` → alerts when data distribution changes
* `regime_controller.py` → adjusts exploration rate by volatility
* `epsilon_scheduler.py` → auto-decays ε weekly

## 🏁 Summary: What Runs After Bootstrap

| Phase | Who Takes Over               | Core Loop                   | Exploration? | Model Type        |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 0–2   | `run_full_bootstrap.py`      | Historical + Live Bootstrap | Mostly Yes   | Random/Rule/Joint |
| 3     | `planner_router.py` + agents | Daily Live Loop             | Mostly No    | Joint + PPO       |

Would you like me to generate:

* ✅ A `daily_runner.py` script that does what `run_full_bootstrap.py` used to — but in production mode?
* ✅ A visual system diagram of pre/post bootstrap agent responsibilities?
